Description:
This program is a first attempt at simulating a barometric
pressure sensor over UART serial port.

The program will read pressure/temperature values from a CSV file,
line-by-line, and transmit them over the serial port to
the other device.

Dependencies:
    - CSV
    - PySerial
    - Time

Pseudocode:
- open serial port and verify that port opened without errors
- open CSV and prepare to read line by line

get one line from CSV and have time and pressure values
    -> this is the initial 
get next line from CSV
    -> this is one ahead, so we have the time difference
       and know how long before we need to read the next value
while (True):
    check serial input to see whether FC wants a measurement
    if yes:
        transmit pressure or temperature based on received value
    else if message == break:
        break

    wait the appropriate amount of time
    update initial line with next line
    read next line
